# **What style/genre would you enjoy learning on guitar?**

Hello everyone! 

My name is Michael and my passion is playing guitar and singing songs! I am here to guide you through whatever style you prefer to play, with over 20 years experience on styles from Rock 'N' Roll, Reggae, Funk, Indie, Metal, Soul, Folk, Pop punk, Grunge and many other styles!!!

I have the experience to honestly say I can teach you any song you desire, also I can help you with original song composition, music theory, along with a guide to singing and band repertoire and bringing confidence and positive attitude to your guitar playing.

We can work out lesson plans that come straight from your musical soul...... For example if you are a keen Guns 'n' Roses fan or if you Love a bit of Bob Marley (who doesn't) then we can go through each lesson and learn any song you desire from your own chosen taste.

For more information on learning this beautiful instrument, message me for details!

Live your life with music and guitar and let it flow and be an expression of your true self!
